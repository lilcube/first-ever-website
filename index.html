      <h1>The History of Computers</h1>
      <h2 id="small-headers">Computers have been around for a surprisingly long amount of time, they just haven't always been what you see today.</h2>
<h3 id="small-headers">Let's have a look at how these machines that work wonders have evolved over the years.</h3>
<p class="paragraphs">The earliest innovation we will look at is the personal computer made by IBM in August of 1981, before this, most working computers could take up an entire room and weren't nearly as advanced as IBM's computer. Other personal computers did exist but IBM were the people who really popularized and set the standard for what a personal computer should be.</p>
<p class="paragraphs">The next computer after IBM's was the Apple Macinstosh in 1984, from it's presentation it seemed like a real step up from IBM's personal computer, the mac came with things like a drawing application and an ability to "talk" as Apple founder Steve Jobs put it. Steve Jobs believed that the target market for his new Macintosh were people who worked desk/office jobs and college workers.</p>
<p class="paragraphs">In November of 1985 Bill Gates' company; Microsoft, released the Windows 1.0 computer and advertised it mainly with the computer's graphical interface. Like with most computers back then they didn't immediately blow up but now Bill Gates is one of the richest men on the planet and Windows is now used by millions of people worldwide.</p>
<p class="paragraphs">This fourth innovation wasn't a new computer, but rather a way to connect all computers, even if they are miles apart from each other. In 1989 Tim Berners-Lee went to CERN, which is the European Organization for Nuclear Research in Switzerland. He proposed the idea for a "distributed information system" and in 1990 the internet's first website was born.</p>
<p class="paragraphs">Personally this final entry is my favorite but that's because I'm a bit of a nerd. In 1994 the Sega Saturn and Sony Playstation released and took the video gaming world by storm, they really popularized video games more and also innovated by using CD discs for games rather than cartridges like previous video game consoles. The consoles had enough power to really make games look detailed, much more than any consoles before them could.</p>
